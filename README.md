### Architecture

```
composeApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ commonMain/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sections/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ androidMain/
â”œâ”€â”€ iosMain/
â”œâ”€â”€ desktopMain/
```

- `components/` â€” atomic reusable elements like cards, avatars, and ripple effects
- `sections/` â€” composed layout blocks like the top greeting or workout section
- `commonMain/App.kt` â€” entry point for all platforms
- `Platform.kt` â€” expect/actual abstraction for target-specific code

### ðŸ§µ Story Behind This Project

I took on the Compose-UI Challenge by [Akshay Nandwana ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³](https://github.com/anandwana001)  
which featured a stunning, visually rich design with Glassmorphism and backdrop blur effects all implemented using Jetpack Compose Multiplatform.

Special thanks to [Akshay Nandwana ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³](https://github.com/anandwana001) for the challenge  
and the Android Engineers community â€” those blog posts came in clutch when I was stuck.
